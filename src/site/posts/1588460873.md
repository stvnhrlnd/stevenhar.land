description: A method for detecting private IP addresses in KQL
---
Recently at work I needed the ability to check if an IP address was private in a KQL query. I eventually arrived at this function:

```text
let ipv4_is_private = (ip: string) {
    ipv4_is_match(ip, '10.0.0.0/8') or
    ipv4_is_match(ip, '172.16.0.0/12') or
    ipv4_is_match(ip, '192.168.0.0/16') or
    ipv4_is_match(ip, '169.254.0.0/16') or
    ipv4_is_match(ip, '127.0.0.0/8')
};
```

It's fairly concise, and I'm pretty happy with it, but I'd be interested to know if there's a better way.
